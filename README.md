<h1>theMacaronMan</h1>
<p>I built a dummy website for a fictitious macaron-only shop set in the future. The main goal here was to test my HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript knowledge that I
have acquired so far. I would say that I have developed a strong understanding of using CSS selectors and advanced pseudo-classes and am becoming more comfortable
with the principle of responsive design.

<p>In 'story.html', the pointing finger icon used to show the web user what tab he/she is currently on was made by me. I took a generic cursor pointer,
captured a screenshot, made further edits using the freeware program Paint, and then saved it as a PNG.
