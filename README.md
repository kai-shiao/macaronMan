<h1>theMacaronMan</h1>
<p>I built a dummy website for a fictitious macaron-only shop set in the future. The main goal here was to test my HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript knowledge that I
have acquired so far. I would say that I have developed a strong understanding of using CSS selectors and advanced pseudo-classes and am becoming more comfortable
with the principle of responsive design.
