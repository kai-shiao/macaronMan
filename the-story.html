	<h1>THE HISTORY</h1>
	<p>In the 2050s, in the midst of the civil war, drought, and lost family members and relatives, 23-year Roman Alamilla left his native hometown 
	Puerto del Sol to start a new beginning and restore dignity to his life. Back home, he was well-known for his passion, skill, experience, and 
	background in the field of pastry arts. Roman was especially known for what neighbours, friends, relatives called gourmet creations, especially 
	cakes. Recognizing that his abilities and talent lay in these "gourmet creations", Roman Alamilla, upon arrival in Fuentes in his adopted homeland 
	of Bonaventura, worked tirelessly to create his distinct brand of macarons that he felt would fill the void in Bonaventura. THE MACARON MAN is the 
	result of his creations.

	<h1>THE INSPIRATION</h1>
	<p> Roman's cakes always had a distinct aroma that could be attributed to his use of natural flavours derived from various prized foods, such as 
	taro root, pistachio, bananas, etc. Therefore, he decided to set up a dedicated macaron patisserie producing macarons using such ingredients. In 
	Bonaventura, known globally as a quality tropical breadbasket with its diverse geography and climate zones, it is never a problem sourcing locally
	available quality ingredients.
